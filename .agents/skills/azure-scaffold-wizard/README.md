## What It Does

When activated, this skill turns your AI coding agent into a **scaffolding wizard** that:

1. **Asks what you want to build** — presents 8 supported project types (RAG chatbot, multi-agent system, API, etc.)
2. **Asks dynamic qualifying questions** — universal questions (project name, language, Azure region, auth, Foundry agent preference, etc.) plus type-specific questions (vector store for RAG, orchestration topology for multi-agent, triggers for Functions, etc.)
3. **Generates a complete project** — every source file, Azure infrastructure, deployment configuration, documentation, CI/CD, and Responsible AI docs

Every scaffolded project is fully deployable with `azd up`. No manual assembly required.

---

## Supported Project Types

The skill ships with **8 first-class project types**. Each has a dedicated reference file with curated questions, folder structures, source code patterns, Bicep modules, and quality checklists.

| # | Type | Reference File | Description |
|---|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | **RAG Chatbot** | `references/rag-chatbot.md` | Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot with vector search (Azure AI Search, Cosmos DB vCore, or pgvector), embedding pipeline, and streaming chat API. Supports Foundry agent mode. |
| 2 | **Multi-Agent System** | `references/multi-agent.md` | Multiple AI agents coordinated by an orchestrator with parallel/sequential/batched topologies. Always uses Microsoft Foundry and MAF. |
| 3 | **API Backend** | `references/api-backend.md` | REST or GraphQL API service with database, authentication middleware, pagination, and rate limiting. Optional Foundry agent for AI inference. |
| 4 | **Data Pipeline** | `references/data-pipeline.md` | ETL/ELT data processing pipeline — batch or streaming — with extractors, transformers, and loaders. Optional Foundry agent for AI enrichment. |
| 5 | **Azure Functions** | `references/function-app.md` | Serverless event-driven functions with HTTP, Timer, Queue, Blob, and Event Grid triggers. Supports Durable Functions. Optional Foundry agent as Container App sidecar. |
| 6 | **Full-Stack Web App** | `references/full-stack-app.md` | Frontend (Next.js, React SPA) + Backend (FastAPI, Express) with typed API client and shared models. Optional Foundry agent for AI features. |
| 7 | **ML Training & Inference** | `references/ml-training.md` | Azure ML workspace with training scripts, pipeline definitions, model registry, and managed online endpoints |
| 8 | **Event-Driven Microservices** | `references/event-driven.md` | Message-based distributed system using Azure Service Bus and/or Event Grid with KEDA scaling and dead-letter handling. Optional Foundry agent for AI processing. |

Types 1–6 and 8 support optional **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** integration (U11), which adds a Foundry-hosted agent with structured output, a two-mode dispatcher for seamless local/cloud routing, and agent registration scripts. Type 2 (Multi-Agent) always uses Foundry. Type 7 (ML Training) uses Azure ML instead.

---

## Installation

### Via skills.sh CLI (recommended)

```bash
npx skills add microsoft/Foundry-AI-solution-templates-creation
```

The CLI will prompt you to choose which agent(s) to install for. It copies the entire skill folder (`SKILL.md` + `references/`) into the agent's skills directory.

### Manual Installation

Clone this repository and copy the entire directory to your agent's skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-AI-solution-templates-creation.git
```

Then copy to the appropriate location:

| Agent | Project-Level Path | Global Path |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | `<project>/.claude/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` | `~/.claude/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `<project>/.agents/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` | `~/.agents/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` |
| **Codex** | — | `~/.codex/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` |
| **Cursor** | `<project>/.agents/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` | `~/.cursor/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` |
| **Windsurf** | `<project>/.agents/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` | `~/.windsurf/skills/azure-scaffold-wizard/` |

**Project-level** installs apply only to that project. **Global** installs apply to all projects on your machine.

---

## Usage

After installation, simply ask your AI agent to scaffold a project using natural language:

```
"Scaffold a RAG chatbot that uses Azure AI Search and gpt-4o for legal document analysis"

"Create a multi-agent solution for insurance claims processing with 4 specialized agents"

"Build an API backend with Cosmos DB and Entra ID auth for a task management app"

"I need a data pipeline that ingests CSV files from blob storage, transforms them, and loads into Cosmos DB"

"Create a serverless Azure Functions app with queue triggers for order processing"

"Build a full-stack web app with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend for a customer portal"

"Set up an ML training pipeline with Azure ML for a text classification model"

"Create an event-driven microservice architecture with Service Bus for an e-commerce platform"
```

The skill activates automatically when it detects a scaffolding request. It then:

1. Presents the project type selection
2. Asks qualifying questions (11 universal + 6-11 type-specific)
3. Generates every file in the project

### Deploying the Generated Project

Once the scaffold is generated:

```bash
cd <generated-project-name>
azd auth login
azd up
```

`azd up` provisions all Azure resources (from the Bicep templates) and deploys the application.

For local development without Azure:

```bash
docker compose up
```

---

## What Gets Generated

Every scaffolded project includes the following. None of these are stubs or placeholders — all files contain complete, functional content.

| Category | What's Included |
|----------|----------------|
| **Source Code** | Complete application code for all services — API endpoints, business logic, data models, configuration, tests |
| **Foundry Agents** | When U11=Yes: agent.yaml descriptors, MAF entry points, structured output schemas, domain skills, two-mode dispatcher, registration scripts |
| **Azure Bicep Infrastructure** | `infra/main.bicep` (subscription-scoped) + modular resource files: AI Foundry, Container Apps, ACR, AI Search, Cosmos DB, Storage, Key Vault, Service Bus, monitoring, RBAC |
| **Deployment Configuration** | `azure.yaml` with preprovision and postprovision hooks for both Windows (PowerShell) and Linux (bash) |
| **Docker** | Multi-stage `Dockerfile` per service + `docker-compose.yml` for full local development without Azure + `.dockerignore` |
| **CI/CD Workflows** | GitHub Actions: `ci.yml` (PR validation — lint, type-check, test, Bicep build) + `deploy.yml` (build, push to ACR, deploy on merge to main) |
| **README** | Project README with badges, architecture overview, quick deploy section, local dev instructions, component details, project structure tree |
| **Architecture Diagrams** | SVG solution architecture diagram + data/agent flow diagram (rendered inline in README) |
| **Responsible AI** | `TRANSPARENCY_FAQ.md` covering all 6 required questions, populated with project-specific content |
| **Supporting Docs** | `architecture.md`, `DeploymentGuide.md`, `production-migration.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, `requirements.md` |
| **Standard Files** | `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `LICENSE`, `.env.example` |
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry setup with Azure Monitor exporter, structured logging, trace correlation |

---

## How It Works

### Architecture — Progressive Disclosure

The skill uses a **progressive disclosure** pattern to stay efficient and context-aware:

```
SKILL.md (core orchestrator, ~330 lines)
    │
    ├── Always loaded first
    │   Contains: 6-step workflow, project type routing table,
    │   universal questions (U1-U11), quality checklist
    │
    ├── Loads ONE type-specific reference file based on user's choice
    │   e.g., references/rag-chatbot.md
    │   Contains: type-specific questions, folder structure,
    │   source file patterns, Bicep modules list, quality checklist
    │
    ├── Conditionally loads Foundry agent patterns (when U11=Yes)
    │   references/foundry-agent-patterns.md
    │   Contains: agent.yaml, MAF entry point, schemas, skills,
    │   two-mode dispatcher, registration script, RBAC requirements
    │
    └── Loads common reference files as needed in Steps 4-5
        references/bicep-patterns.md    → Azure infrastructure
        references/azure-yaml-patterns.md → Deployment config
        references/docker-patterns.md    → Container setup
        references/readme-template.md    → Documentation
        references/cicd-patterns.md      → CI/CD workflows
        references/responsible-ai.md     → RAI documentation
        references/architecture-diagrams.md → SVG diagrams
        references/observability-patterns.md → Monitoring
        references/security-patterns.md  → Auth, RBAC, networking
```

**Why this matters**: The agent only loads reference files relevant to the user's choice. A user building a RAG chatbot never loads the multi-agent patterns, and vice versa. This keeps the agent's context focused and produces higher-quality output.

### Workflow — The 6-Step Process

| Step | Name | What Happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| **1** | **Identify & Gather Requirements** | Present 8 project types. Ask 11 universal questions (U1-U11). Load type-specific reference file and ask its questions (e.g., R1-R11 for RAG). If U11=Yes, also load `foundry-agent-patterns.md`. Document all answers in `docs/requirements.md`. |
| **2** | **Generate Project Structure** | Create the complete folder layout — common root files + type-specific directories from the reference file. |
| **3** | **Generate Source Files** | Follow the type-specific reference file's generation instructions to produce all application code with complete, functional implementations. |
| **4** | **Generate Infrastructure & Deployment** | Load `bicep-patterns.md` → generate `main.bicep` + all modules. Load `azure-yaml-patterns.md` → generate `azure.yaml` + hooks. Load `docker-patterns.md` → generate Dockerfiles + compose. |
| **5** | **Generate Documentation** | Load `readme-template.md`, `architecture-diagrams.md`, `responsible-ai.md`, `cicd-patterns.md` → generate README, SVGs, TRANSPARENCY_FAQ, workflows, supporting docs. |
| **6** | **Quality Checklist** | Run universal checks (Bicep scoping, secrets, hooks, Docker, CI/CD, SVGs) + type-specific checks from the reference file. |

### Adaptive Questioning

Questions are asked in two phases:

1. **Universal questions (U1-U11)** — asked for ALL project types: business problem, end users, project name, programming language, Azure region, authentication, additional Azure services, frontend needed, compliance requirements, deployment platform, and Azure AI Foundry Agent Service preference.

2. **Type-specific questions** — asked only for the selected project type. For example:
   - **RAG Chatbot** (R1-R11): vector store, embedding model, chunking strategy, LLM, context window, conversation memory, streaming, reranking, top-k, Foundry mode
   - **Multi-Agent** (T1-T10): agent names/roles, orchestration topology, MCP tools, model, regions, SKU
   - **API Backend** (A1-A10): endpoints, database, API style, pagination, rate limiting, versioning, AI inclusion

Users only see questions relevant to their project type.

---

## Unsupported Project Types — Fallback Behavior

If a user requests a project type that is **not one of the 8 supported types** (e.g., "Build me a real-time IoT telemetry dashboard"), the skill still works but with reduced precision:

1. The agent maps the request to the **closest supported type** or **combines patterns** from multiple types (e.g., IoT dashboard = Event-Driven + Full-Stack Web App)
2. Universal questions (U1-U11) are still asked
3. The agent loads the closest reference file(s) and adapts the type-specific questions
4. The scaffold is generated using the adapted patterns

**What works well in fallback mode:**
- Universal infrastructure (Bicep, azure.yaml, Docker, CI/CD, README, Responsible AI docs)
- Common Azure service modules (monitoring, ACR, ACA, RBAC)
- Project structure conventions and deployment configuration

**What may be less precise in fallback mode:**
- Type-specific questions may not be perfectly tailored to the novel use case
- Source code patterns are adapted from the closest type rather than purpose-built
- Folder structure may not perfectly match the ideal layout for the novel type
- The quality checklist won't have type-specific validation items

**Recommendation**: If you frequently scaffold a project type that isn't supported, [add a new reference file](#extending-the-skill--adding-new-project-types) to make it a first-class citizen.

## Known Limitations

### Scaffold Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Not production-ready out of the box** | Generated scaffolds are solution accelerators — starting points. They require security hardening, load testing, and compliance review before production use. See the generated `docs/production-migration.md` for specifics. |
| **No authentication by default** | Scaffolds ship without auth enabled for simplicity. Production use requires Microsoft Entra ID integration (patterns documented in `references/security-patterns.md`). |
| **In-memory storage defaults** | Conversation memory (RAG), session state, and caching default to in-memory implementations that are lost on restart. Production requires persistent stores (Cosmos DB, Redis). |
| **English language only** | Generated code, prompts, and documentation are in English. Multilingual support is not scaffolded unless explicitly requested. |
| **Azure-only deployment** | All infrastructure targets Azure (Bicep, azd, ACA/Functions/AKS). AWS and GCP deployment are not supported. |
| **Python-first patterns** | While the skill asks about programming language (Python, TypeScript, C#), the reference file patterns are most detailed for Python. TypeScript and C# patterns are less comprehensive. |

### Skill Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **8 supported project types** | Only the 8 listed types have dedicated reference files with curated patterns. Other types fall back to closest-match behavior (see [Fallback Behavior](#unsupported-project-types--fallback-behavior)). |
| **Agent context window** | Very large projects may strain the agent's context window. The progressive disclosure architecture mitigates this, but complex multi-service scaffolds with many components may require multiple agent sessions. |
| **No interactive preview** | The skill generates all files in one pass. There is no "preview and confirm" step between file generation. |
| **Reference file staleness** | Azure API versions, SDK versions, and best practices evolve. Reference files may contain outdated API versions or deprecated patterns over time. Regular maintenance is required. |
| **SVG diagram quality** | Architecture diagrams are generated as SVG by the LLM. Quality varies by agent — some agents produce better SVG than others. Manual touch-up may be needed. |
| **No incremental scaffolding** | The skill generates a new project from scratch each time. It does not modify existing projects or add features to previously scaffolded projects. |
| **No validation of Azure quotas** | The scaffold assumes sufficient Azure quota/capacity. It does not check if your subscription can provision the requested resources (e.g., GPU quota for ML training). |

### AI-Specific Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **LLM output variability** | Different agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Codex) may produce slightly different scaffolds from the same questions, because each LLM interprets instructions differently. |
| **Hallucination risk** | While the reference files constrain the agent's output, the LLM may still generate code that references non-existent APIs, incorrect SDK methods, or wrong Bicep resource properties. Always review generated code. |
| **No execution or testing** | The skill instructs the agent to generate files but does not execute or test them. `az bicep build`, `docker compose config`, and test suites should be run manually after scaffolding. |

### Foundry Agent Limitations (U11=Yes)

| Limitation | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **No token-level streaming** | Foundry agents return structured JSON responses. True SSE streaming (token-by-token) requires hand-rolled mode (U11=No). Foundry mode can wrap the response in an SSE event for frontend compatibility, but the response arrives as a single payload. |
| **Stateless agents** | Foundry agents are stateless per-request — no built-in conversation memory. If persistent memory is needed (R7=Cosmos DB or Redis), a separate session store must be implemented in the backend, or choose hand-rolled mode. |
| **Registration script placeholder** | The `register_agents.py` script contains placeholder comments for the Foundry SDK registration calls, as the SDK API is still evolving. Actual registration code must be implemented based on the specific Foundry SDK version available at deploy time. |
| **Local mode requires Azure OpenAI** | In Docker Compose local mode, agents fall back to `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` for model calls. This requires an Azure OpenAI resource to be provisioned even for local development. |

---

## Extending the Skill — Adding New Project Types

Adding a new project type is the most common extension. It requires **one new file** and **two table row edits**.

### Step 1: Create a Reference File

Create `references/<new-type>.md` with these required sections:

```markdown
# <Type Name> — Scaffold Pattern

Brief description of what this type scaffolds.

---

## Type-Specific Questions

| # | Question | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| X1 | **Question text?** | How to interpret the answer. |
| X2 | ... | ... |

---

## Project Folder Structure

<project-slug>/
├── src/
│   └── ...
└── tests/
    └── ...

---

## Source File Generation Instructions

### <file-path>

(Code patterns with explanation of when to use which variant)

---

## Bicep Modules Required

- List of which Bicep modules from `references/bicep-patterns.md` this type needs
- Plus any new modules that need to be added

---

## Type-Specific Quality Checklist

- [ ] Check item 1
- [ ] Check item 2
```

Look at `references/rag-chatbot.md` or `references/api-backend.md` as templates.

### Step 2: Add to SKILL.md Routing Tables

In `SKILL.md`, add one row to **Step 1A** (Project Type Selection):

```markdown
| 9 | **<New Type>** | <Description> | <When to choose> |
```

And one row to **Step 1C** (Type-Specific Requirements):

```markdown
| <New Type> | `references/<new-type>.md` | <What questions it adds> |
```

### Step 3: Update `references/project-types.md`

Add the new type to the project types catalog with a full description.

### Examples of Types You Could Add

| Type | Reference File | Key Questions |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| IoT Telemetry | `references/iot-telemetry.md` | Device protocols (MQTT, AMQP), IoT Hub vs Event Hub, time-series DB, device provisioning |
| Chatbot with Plugins | `references/chatbot-plugins.md` | Plugin registry, tool calling patterns, safety filters, multi-turn memory |
| Document Intelligence | `references/doc-intelligence.md` | Document types (invoices, contracts, forms), AI Document Intelligence models, output format |
| Batch Inference | `references/batch-inference.md` | Input format, model type, parallelism, result storage, SLA |
| GraphRAG | `references/graphrag.md` | Knowledge graph store, entity extraction, community summarization, graph traversal |
| Real-Time Analytics | `references/real-time-analytics.md` | Stream source, windowing functions, dashboard framework, alerting |

---

## Extending the Skill — Adding New Common Patterns

Common patterns (in `references/`) are shared across all project types. To add a new common pattern:

1. Create `references/<new-pattern>.md` with the pattern content
2. Reference it from the appropriate step in `SKILL.md` (Step 4 for infrastructure, Step 5 for documentation)
3. Each type-specific reference file can optionally reference it

**Examples:**
- `references/api-management.md` — Azure API Management gateway patterns
- `references/redis-patterns.md` — Azure Cache for Redis integration
- `references/vnet-patterns.md` — Full VNet topology with private endpoints
- `references/terraform-patterns.md` — Terraform alternative to Bicep (if multi-IaC support is desired)

---

## Extending the Skill — Modifying Existing Patterns

To update existing patterns (e.g., newer Azure API versions, updated SDK methods):

1. Edit the relevant `references/*.md` file directly
2. Update API versions in `references/bicep-patterns.md` when Azure releases new stable versions
3. Update SDK patterns in type-specific files when libraries release breaking changes
4. Update CI/CD steps in `references/cicd-patterns.md` when GitHub Actions versions change

**Maintenance checklist** (recommended quarterly):
- [ ] Verify Bicep API versions are current
- [ ] Verify Python/TypeScript SDK versions in source patterns
- [ ] Verify GitHub Actions action versions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`)
- [ ] Verify Azure CLI / azd commands haven't changed
- [ ] Test at least one scaffold end-to-end per project type

## Reference File Anatomy

Every reference file follows a consistent structure so agents can parse them reliably:

### Type-Specific Reference Files

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Title + Description** | What this type scaffolds and when to use it |
| **Type-Specific Questions** | Table of questions (ID, question, guidance) asked only for this type |
| **Project Folder Structure** | Complete directory tree with annotations |
| **Source File Generation Instructions** | Code patterns per file, with variant selection based on question answers |
| **Bicep Modules Required** | Which modules from `bicep-patterns.md` to include, plus any new ones |
| **Type-Specific Quality Checklist** | Validation items specific to this project type |

### Common Reference Files

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Design Principles** | Rules and conventions the agent must follow |
| **Templates** | Complete code/config templates with parameterized placeholders |
| **Variants** | Alternative implementations selected based on user answers |
| **Conventions** | Naming, formatting, and structural standards |

---

## Compatibility

### Tested Agents

| Agent | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | Supported | Full file-read and file-write capabilities. Best support for progressive disclosure (reads reference files on demand). |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Supported | Works via `.agents/skills/` directory. May have shorter context windows — progressive disclosure helps. |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Supported | Works via `~/.codex/skills/` directory. Strong code generation capabilities. |
| **Cursor** | Compatible | Uses `.agents/skills/` convention. |
| **Windsurf** | Compatible | Uses `.agents/skills/` convention. |
| **Other skills.sh agents** | Compatible | Any agent that supports the Agent Skills specification should work. |

### Requirements
