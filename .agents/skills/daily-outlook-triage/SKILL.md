# Daily Outlook Triage

This skill provides a comprehensive overview of your day by analyzing your inbox emails and calendar meetings, helping you quickly triage and prioritize your workday.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Identifies you** using Microsoft Graph to get your profile and time zone
2. **Pulls inbox emails** to surface unread and important messages requiring attention
3. **Retrieves today's meetings** from your calendar with details
4. **Generates a triage summary** highlighting priorities, conflicts, and action items

## Instructions

### Step 1: Get User Profile and Time Zone

```
workiq-ask_work_iq (
  question: "What is my profile information including display name, email address, and time zone settings?"
)
```

Extract the user's **displayName**, **email**, and **timeZone** from the response. This provides:
- User identity for personalized greeting
- Time zone for accurate meeting times

### Step 2: Pull Inbox Emails

Search for recent emails in the inbox:

```
workiq-ask_work_iq (
  question: "Show me my unread and recent inbox emails from the last 24 hours. For each email include the sender name and email, subject line, received time, importance level, and whether it has attachments."
)
```

For each relevant email, note:
- Sender name and email
- Subject line
- Received time
- Importance flag (high priority emails)
- Whether it has attachments

### Step 3: Get Today's Calendar

Retrieve all meetings for today:

```
workiq-ask_work_iq (
  question: "List all my calendar events for today with subject, start time, end time, location, attendees, whether I'm the organizer, and my response status for each."
)
```

For each meeting, capture:
- Subject/title
- Start and end times
- Location (physical or Teams link)
- Attendees
- Whether user is organizer or attendee
- Response status (accepted, tentative, declined)

### Step 4: Generate Triage Summary

Create a structured summary with the following sections:

#### 📅 Today's Schedule Overview
- Total number of meetings
- First meeting start time
- Any back-to-back meetings (potential conflicts)
- Total meeting hours vs free time
- Highlight all-day events

#### 📧 Inbox Highlights
- Count of unread emails
- High-importance emails requiring immediate attention
- Emails from VIPs (manager, skip-level, key stakeholders)
- Action items or requests identified in subject lines

#### ⚠️ Attention Required
- Meeting conflicts or overlaps
- Meetings starting soon (within 30 minutes)
- Unresponded meeting invites
- High-priority unread emails

#### 📋 Suggested Priorities
Based on the analysis, suggest:
1. Urgent items to address first
2. Meetings to prepare for
3. Emails that need responses
4. Blocks of free time for focused work

## Output Format

Present the summary in a clear, scannable format:

```
Good morning, {Name}! Here's your day at a glance:

📅 MEETINGS ({count} today)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⏰ 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM | Team Standup
   📍 Teams | 👥 5 attendees

```

## Error Handling

### Common Failure Modes

#### Authentication or Permission Errors
- **Symptom**: `ask_work_iq` returns an authentication or permission error.
- **Cause**: The user's session token is expired or the required Microsoft Graph permissions (Mail.Read, Calendars.Read, User.Read) have not been granted.
- **Resolution**: Prompt the user to re-authenticate with their Microsoft 365 account and confirm the necessary API permissions are enabled.

#### WorkIQ CLI Unavailable
- **Symptom**: `ask_work_iq` fails to respond or returns a connection error.
- **Cause**: The local WorkIQ CLI MCP server is not running or misconfigured.
- **Resolution**: Notify the user that the WorkIQ CLI is unreachable. Suggest verifying the server configuration and retrying.

#### No Emails Returned
- **Symptom**: `ask_work_iq` returns no email results for the requested period.
- **Cause**: No emails were received in the specified lookback window, or the question did not match any messages.
- **Resolution**: Inform the user that no recent inbox emails were found. Retry with a broader time window (e.g., "last 48 hours") before concluding the inbox is empty.

#### No Calendar Events Found
- **Symptom**: `ask_work_iq` returns no calendar events for today.
- **Cause**: The user genuinely has no meetings, or the date context was ambiguous.
- **Resolution**: Rephrase the question with an explicit date. If the response confirms no events, report that the calendar is clear for today.

#### Incorrect or Missing Time Zone
- **Symptom**: Meeting times appear in UTC or are offset by several hours.
- **Cause**: The profile query did not return time zone information, or the calendar question did not specify a time zone.
- **Resolution**: Fall back to UTC and explicitly note in the summary that times are shown in UTC. Prompt the user to confirm their preferred time zone.

#### Partial Data Retrieved
- **Symptom**: One `ask_work_iq` call succeeds but another returns an error or incomplete data.
- **Resolution**: Present the sections that did complete successfully. Clearly label any missing section (e.g., "⚠️ Calendar unavailable — could not retrieve today's meetings") so the user knows the summary is incomplete and can take manual action.
